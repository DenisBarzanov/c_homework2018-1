The homework...

I have sources and tests.

I decided to compile the sources into a static C library
and then link it with the tests (Google Tests) in the test/ folder

To compile:
$   make src

To test:
$   make test

You could always compile things by hand, if you'd like to do so,
I've left a main.c file in the project root for you to link with
the .o files that you have compiled
